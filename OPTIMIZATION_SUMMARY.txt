# 🚀 Website Performance Optimization Complete!

## Summary of Changes

Your website loading time has been **dramatically optimized** through comprehensive performance improvements. Here's what was done:

---

## ⚡ **Major Performance Improvements**

### 1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading** ✅
- **LandingPage split from 770 lines → Multiple small chunks**
- Heavy components now load only when needed:
  - `GlobeDemo` (Three.js 3D globe)
  - `BackgroundBeamsWithCollision` (Animation library)
  - `AssessmentEngine`
  - `LibrarySection` & `ResourceSection`
  - All below-the-fold sections (Bento, Security, Pricing, Footer)

### 2. **Dynamic Imports with Suspense** ✅
- Implemented React Suspense boundaries
- Added loading states for all lazy-loaded components
-Prevents blocking render during component load

### 3. **Font Optimization** ✅
- **Removed duplicate font loading** (was loading twice!)
- Added `font-display: swap` for faster initial render
- Added preconnect hints for Google Fonts CDN
- Font loading now managed by Next.js optimization

### 4. **Next.js Configuration Enhancements** ✅
```typescript
- Image optimization (AVIF/WebP formats)
- Compress enabled
- Package import optimization for:
  - lucide-react
  - framer-motion  
  - react-icons
- Removed poweredByHeader for slightly smaller responses
```

### 5. **Module Organization** ✅
Created separate section components for better code splitting:
- `ProcessSection.tsx` (Assessment Engine)
- `BentoSection.tsx` (Feature cards)
- `SecuritySection.tsx`
- `PricingSection.tsx`
- `FooterSection.tsx`
